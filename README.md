# Linux Server & Client Configuration (Fedora)

This project was developed as part of my Computer Engineering Technology program at Seneca Polytechnic. It involved designing and configuring a **virtualized serverâ€“client environment** using Fedora 38 on VMware Workstation Pro to simulate an enterprise IT infrastructure.

## Project Overview
The Fedora server was configured to provide multiple core IT services to connected Linux and Windows clients. These included:
- **DNS (BIND):** Domain resolution with forward and reverse lookup zones  
- **DHCP:** Dynamic IP allocation with reservations for critical devices  
- **Apache Web Server:** Hosting internal webpages  
- **Samba & NFS:** Cross-platform file sharing between Linux and Windows clients  
- **Email (Postfix & Dovecot):** Internal mail server with IMAP/SMTP access  
- **Firewall (Firewalld):** Service-based rules for security hardening  
- **Automation:** Bash scripts scheduled with cron for periodic system backups  

## What I Did
- Installed and configured a Fedora server with DNS, DHCP, web hosting, file sharing, and mail services.  
- Deployed Linux and Windows clients to validate service functionality and connectivity.  
- Applied firewall rules to restrict unnecessary services and secure access.  
- Wrote and tested Bash scripts for backup automation with cron jobs.  
- Documented the configuration process, service testing, and results.  

## What I Learned
This project helped me gain hands-on skills in:  
- Linux system administration and enterprise service deployment  
- Network service configuration and troubleshooting  
- Security hardening using firewall rules and permissions  
- Automation and reliability through Bash scripting and cron scheduling  
- Cross-platform connectivity between Linux and Windows environments
