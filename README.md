# Linux Server & Client Configuration (Fedora)

This project was completed as part of my Computer Engineering Technology program at Seneca Polytechnic.  
It focused on designing and configuring a **virtualized serverâ€“client environment** using Fedora on VMware Workstation Pro.

## What I Did
- Installed and configured a Fedora server to provide core IT services: **DNS, DHCP, Apache web server, Samba/NFS file sharing, and Email (Postfix/Dovecot)**.  
- Set up Linux and Windows clients to test connectivity and validate services.  
- Enforced security using **Firewalld rules** and automated system backups with Bash scripts and cron jobs.  
- Documented the setup with configuration details, screenshots, and troubleshooting notes.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Linux system administration and service configuration  
- Enterprise-style networking and file sharing  
- Security hardening with firewalls and permissions  
- Automation using Bash scripting and scheduling
